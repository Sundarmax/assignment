Please Go through the following steps inorder to run the python script.
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------#
I have recommended you to check the output for second question then do check first one
Because the configuration is same for both. 
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------#

Requirements:

1)  python 3.6.8.   - You can download it from their official Website 
                    - click this link to download the executable file for windows.
                    - "https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/"

2) setup virtual
    environmenet    - once the python is installed successfully then we have to setup virtual env.
                      It's a kind of isolated environmenet where the python packages were managed. 
                      #--------------------------------------------------------------------------#
                      please follow the step 3 on the below link and skip the rest. 
                      "https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/how-to-setup-a-python-virtual-environment-on-windows-10/"

3) pip installation - when you install python, pip library is automatically installed
                    - and we activated the virtual environmenet too.
                    - Now it is the time to install django and rest of the packages. 
                    - you can locate this path "assignment\question - 2\myapp\" you will get
                      one file named "requirements.txt"
                    - As we know we already activated the virtual environmenet so you can 
                      run this command to install list of packages in requirements.txt file. 
                      pip install -r requirements.txt 

4) Check output     - You can check the output by running the below command at windows terminal. 
                      first locate this path -- > "assignment\question - 1"
                      then you can type "python script.py" and see the output
